                    <p class='m-2'>Lost in Library will select four random unplayed games from your Steam Library and
                        add them to
                        the board. When you select New Game, you will see a sequence of these games presented on the
                        board. Once the sequence is complete, you must remember the pattern and select the correct games
                        in the same order using the buttons below. If you succeed, the next round will start with one
                        additional turn in the sequence. If you fail, you must restart the game, or go download the game
                        that beat you and give it a chance!</p><br>
                    <p class='m-2'>
                        The player wins if they successfully complete round ten. The prize for your victory is that you
                        are absolved of any guilt for ignoring your backlog of unplayed games and are free to replay an
                        old favourite once again. If the player loses, they will be presented with some info about the
                        game they should have picked that may entice you to give it a shot.
