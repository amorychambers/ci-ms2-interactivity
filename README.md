## Project Goals

This is a memory game that challenges the player to remember a sequence of ten games that are briefly shown on screen before they are prompted to enter the same sequence again. The game makes use of an API provided by the gaming platform and distributor, Steam, to access a user's public profile data and generate the sequence using only games they own, which adds a layer of familiarity to the challenge. The website aims to be engaging by focusing on interactivity, user feedback, and a personalised experience. It is intended to be a fun, accessible experience showcasing interactivity between a user and a website.

### User Goals

- A clear and concise understanding of the game experience the website offers
- A visually clean and uncluttered presentation that focuses the user's attention on the parts of the page they can interact with to personalise or engage with the game
- The site accounts for all interactive elements of the user's experiences, particularly when there is an error or incompatibility with user input


### Site Goals

- Uses interactivity to focus and hold a user's attention
- Offers a personalised and thus more memorable experience
- Connects with the user demographic and communicates the experience offered in a fitting and appropriate way


### Developer Goals

- The website looks good and functions properly in all interactive and non-interactive elements on a range of devices
- The game functions well on all devices and is clear and consistent to play
- The site is accessible to a wide range of users and is easy to navigate
- Offer a personalised experience and communicate clearly to the user how they can interact with the application

## User Experience

### Target Audience

- Steam users and games enthusiasts
- Any user that wants to play a simple memory game

### User Stories 

#### First-time User
As a first-time user, I want to:

1. Understand what the site is offering and why at first glance
2. Grasp the rules of the game before starting to play
3. Be able to easily decide what parameters of the game I want to change
4. Still be able to play the game if I am not a Steam user or am not seeking a personalised game experience
5. Know how the game works and how it is processing my personal data
6. Play on whatever device I am using
7. Easily contact the creator of the site if I have questions or feedback
8. Navigate around the site with ease and clarity

#### Returning User
As a returning user, I want to:

9. Start the game quickly, as I already understand the rules
10. Start a new game when the first game is finished
11. Choose how I want to play the game 
12. Have a new experience each time I play
13. Be surprised by games in my game library that I haven't played
